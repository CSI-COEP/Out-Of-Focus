          <div>The Taj Mahal is an Islamic ivory-white marble mausoleum on the right bank of the river Yamuna in Agra, Uttar Pradesh, India.An immense mausoleum of white marble, built in Agra between 1631 and 1648 by order of the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favourite wife, the Taj Mahal is the jewel of Muslim art in India and one of the universally admired masterpieces of the world's heritage.The Taj Mahal is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect.The four free-standing minarets at the corners of the platform added a hitherto unknown dimension to the Mughal architecture. The four minarets provide not only a kind of spatial reference to the monument but also give a three dimensional effect to the edifice.The Taj Mahal is a perfect symmetrical planned building, with an emphasis of bilateral symmetry along a central axis on which the main features are placed. The building material used is brick-in-lime mortar veneered with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semi precious stones.</div>

          <div>Situated bang in the heart of the old city of Hyderabad, the Charminar (Urdu ‘Char’ meaning Four and ‘Minar’ meaning Tower) is one of the most recognized monuments in India. It is the architectural icon for the city of Hyderabad, equivalent to the likes of the Taj Mahal of Agra or the Eiffel Tower of Paris and is the most searched historical site of the city on Google. The imposing monument stands regally tall amidst the colorful bangle shops in the labyrinthine Laad Bazar of the old city and presents a beautiful glittering sight after nightfall (7pm-9pm). It is currently maintained by the Archeological Survey of India. The Charminar is situated on the eastern banks of Musi River with the Makka Masjid, another famous Qutub Shahi architecture, in the vicinity.This 400-years-old structure was built by Sultan Muhammed Quli Qutb Shah, the 5th Sultan of the illustrious Qutb Shahi dynasty. An inseparable part of the history of Hyderabad, the Sultan built the monument right after shifting his capital from Golkonda to Hyderabad. Historians opine that the inadequacy of water and plague forced Quli Qutub Shah to construct a new city.He prayed to the Almighty to end his people’s suffering and pledged to build a mosque at the very site where he prayed.</div>

          <div>There are certain destinations that will leave a lasting impression on you, even years after your visit; and they keep calling you back, no matter how far away you are. Mahabalipuram or Mamallapuram is one such city that you won’t feel like leaving once you are here. Drenched in an enigmatic old-age charm, the city will amaze you with its rich history, thriving present and prospects of a glorious future. Noted in history as a busy port town, Mahabalipuram rose in stature and importance during the period between 4th and 9th century when the Pallava dynasty ruled the land. The heydays of the Pallavas saw the building many impressive architectural wonders, many of which continue to fascinate visitors to this day. The temples built during this era loudly proclaim the glory of the Dravidian architectural genre. The highlight of this style can be seen in the ornate stone carvings made from uncut rocks. The splendour of sculptures that adorn these temples are simply stunning. The classic example of this is the Shore temple, one of the oldest temples in India built out of blocks of granite. These majestic structures and their relics that can be seen today, have made Mahabalipuram a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</div>
